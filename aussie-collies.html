  <h1>Australian Shepherd Border Collie Mix</h1>
  <h2>The best dog there is!</h2>
  <p>Here are the reasosns I want one:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cute</li>
    <li>Smart</li>
    <li>Family friendly</li>
    <li>Very athletic</li>
    <li>Crowd pleaser</li>
    <li>Not too big</li>
    <li>Not too small</li>
    <li>Geneticly more healthy</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What should you expect?</h2>
  <p>
    I'm not an expert by any means, however through some research I've found they are extremely
    active and need lots of exercise. They must be well trained and socialized at a young age to prevent unwanted
    behaviors.
    Without proper training they can nip young children or other smaller animals due to their instinct to herd.
